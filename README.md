# Airbnb Database Project

## 📖 About the Project
This project is part of the comprehensive **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding.  
By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring **scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality**.  

The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing **high standards of design, development, and data handling**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.  
- Master the art of **normalization** to optimize efficiency and minimize redundancy.  
- Use **SQL DDL** to define database schema with constraints, keys, and indexing.  
- Write and execute **SQL DML** scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data.  
- Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

## ✅ Requirements
To successfully complete this project, you must:

- Have a strong foundation in relational databases and SQL.  
- Be proficient in using **Draw.io** or similar tools for visual modeling.  
- Understand data normalization principles (up to **3NF**).  
- Have experience with **GitHub repositories** for documentation and project submission.  
- Follow **industry best practices** for database design and scripting.  

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Task 1:** Craft a detailed **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to visualize the database design.  
- **Task 2:** Apply **normalization principles** to refine your design.  
- **Task 3:** Create **SQL scripts** to define the database schema, with primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.  
- **Task 4:** Populate the database with **real-world sample data** (users, properties, bookings, payments, etc.).  

Each task builds on the previous one, providing a step-by-step approach to developing a **robust database system**.
